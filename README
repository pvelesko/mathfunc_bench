# Testbed for measuring accuracy and performance of math functions in SYCL

Compilers and Backends supported:
1. Intel DPCPP compiler, gen9
2. hipSYCL for CUDA Devices
3. Intel LLVM and Codeplay's CUDA backend https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/sycl-for-cuda should work, but current issue with linking math library calls

## Getting Started
export SYCL_DEVICE=cpu/gpu/host/cuda
make intel; 
make hipsycl;

## Notes
hipSYCL does not support event profiling nor USM so buffers and system timers must be used. 
Since the entire offload region is measured, select n large enough  so that one-time offload costs are negligible compared to function call
